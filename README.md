## Background ##

It all started with a prototype i made to automate the task of checking if my current course have updated a new lecture, so i built a script with BeatifulSoup, Requests and
the discord api wrapper discord.py. It was short and did what i wanted, but it ended at that. If i wanted to scrape another website i had to make another entire program almost, so out came the idea to make one program for all kind of scraping, quick, easy and accessible is what i had in mind
